       "'Le Bristol was just perfect during my trip to visit my son in Paris. With the pandemic, I was concerned if it would be the same sublime experience as it was in 2018 when I was last there. In some ways, it was even more so as they managed to meet and exceed cleanliness while at the same time not skipping a beat on providing outstanding service and truly three Michelin-star quality food. The atmosphere was so warm and helpful. I must again thank the concierge team led by Jean-Marie Burlet. They not only recommended excellent restaurants for us to try, local shops to visit, but they also secured hard to come by reservations for us, and tickets to exhibits. They also expertly packed up and mailed back to the States my purchases. Le Bristol is simply the best hotel. When I arrived I was greeted as an old friend. Jean-Marie remembered me and during my 8 night visit told me I’m family. It’s not often one feels that way about a hotel, but I must say the feeling is mutual. The Bristol is family to me too. Thank you.'"

In some ways, it was even more so as they managed to meet and exceed cleanliness while at the same time not skipping a beat on providing outstanding service and truly three Michelin-star quality food. The atmosphere was so warm and helpful. They not only recommended excellent restaurants for us to try, local shops to visit, but they also secured hard to come by reservations for us, and tickets to exhibits. Le Bristol is simply the best hotel. Jean-Marie remembered me and during my 8 night visit told me I’m family. The Bristol is family to me too.'"
