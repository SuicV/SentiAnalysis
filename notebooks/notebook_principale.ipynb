    "La méthode se base sur un lexique d'opinion proposé par Hu et Liu [lien vers le lexicon](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html#lexicon), pour déterminer la polarité d'un mot. Le lexique contient 6'800  mots divisés en mots positifs et négatifs.\n",

    "Cette méthode parcourt tous les tokens (mots, ponctuation, numéros, ...) dans la phrase traitée. Si le mot traité est dans le lexicon, on obtient sa polarité à partir de la liste (pos ou neg) où il appartient. Ensuite on utilise la technique [Dependency Parsing](https://realpython.com/natural-language-processing-spacy-python/#dependency-parsing-using-spacy) [(explication profond)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/14.pdf), pour récupérer la dépendance grammaticale entre le token traité (sentiment) et les autres token dans la phrase, afin d'extraire l'aspect dont le sentiment est lié.\n",

    "- Vérifier si le mot positif affecte un score de 1, si non affecter un score de -1.\n",

    "    - Si le mot s’agit d’un adjectif on extrait le mot dont il est lié comme un aspect, également on vérifie si l'adjectif lié à une négation et a un mot d'intensité pour augmenter l’intensité de sentiment. exemple :"

(in a rough intonation!). the next day, friday, i was supposed to be picked up by my tour guide at 8:45 am at the lobby. so i asked the same front desk guy (he's the only one there during he days plus his bell boy nadir), if he can call the local number that i have of the tour guide so i can see where he is. it was busy, and this front desk guy heard the busy tone and said \"they're not answering\" and took the phone from me! .... i called front desk around 9 am and the same front desk guy answered. his reply was plain and simple \"no! 12 am is check out time!\" i took a shower and checked out at 11 am!!!! i went to the front desk counter, (he was the one there), and i said i was checking out. i gave my card, he swiped it, gave my card back, and that was that. he just said \"yes!\" no have a good flight, or have a good rest of your day, that you would expect from a \"four star hotel\" that they claim they are! i am disgraced by the misconduct and rudeness of our front desk clerk and it made me uncomfortable around him and the hotel. i hope you can do something about this because your clientele will drop tremendously if this continues. \n",

      "reviews 2297 : having read all of the reviews on this site i feel justified in making my own comments now. we arrived fairly late in the afternoon and only took the room because there didn't seem to be other option available (we hadn't been into the town at that point). tired, and longing for a hot shower and a good night's sleep we decided to overlook the immediate lack of charm or facilities and said we would stay. i noticed a dirty old piece of paper stuck to the end of the bed base which indicated that more pillows were available in the drawer of the base. i took them over to the main building, once again interrupting the card playing duo. she then accompanied me back to the cabins and offered two pillows from an adjacent room. then we looked closer - filthy, stained, smelly carpet that you wouldn't wish to set a naked foot on; tiny, dirty bathroom with a mouldy shower, a grubby wash basin and plumbing which seemed to leak from the wall. i pulled back the bedspread with some trepidation, despite the fact that the staff member assured me that the bed linen was changed on a regular basis (once a year perhaps??). to be fair it did appear clean but the grubby cups and the fur scaled jug sitting on a sticky bench suggested that cleaning wasn't a priority of the management. everything but everything smacked of a total lack of concern, care or good housekeeping practice. and the general air of dilapidation was astounding. after booking in we scurried back to the no star ben mor lodge where we packed the car, returned the key (yes, they were still playing cards) advised them of our departure and were told that they weren't surprised we were leaving. i have no idea what the meals might have been like (some reviewers have praised them) because the idea of sitting at the grubby tartan stools or at the dirty, sticky tables really had as much appeal as the tiny cabin room we vacated. i've formed the impression that the owners wouldn't have learned much from any other establishment they might have stayed in or, indeed the reviews on this site either as they haven't commented on the many unfavourable reviews. \n",

      "reviews 2772 : we were looking for a nice weekend getaway outside of shanghai and we wanted to spend some money on a nice hotel. so i can say that i am familiar with the value at this price level. this hotel was a huge disappointment. they said they were out of king bed rooms and therefore if we wanted one we would have to pay extra. we finally got them to upgrade us to \"luxury\" room after some arguing. in my opinion, if the hotel has room, why not upgrade your customer if you promised them something that is no longer available - the rooms are very outdated for a soften. this was not 5 star quality. but you must pay to use them--pay for the sauna!! the windows in the really gross lobby overlook the street and you cannot see the west lake at all. we tried to get a taxi to take us to a nearby town (moganshan) and the concierge, who could barely speak english, told me it would take 2 hours and 500rmb. i was so frustrated that the hotel couldn't figure out how to help us and instead they relied on the information from a \"taxi\" they called. these might not seem like major things but when you are paying these prices, there are clearly hotels that \"get it\" and are willing to give you the service you are paying for and deserve. p.s. i am writing this right now in my room at the soften because i am so upset with this experience. \n",

(yes there are some) as soon as a dirty cup or plate was put down it was cleared away so no issues at all with the cleanliness. the views were stupendous and we could never get enough of either looking at the mountains or the sea, we had a side room so had a wonderful view of both. the local shops and restaurants were great, we visited seagulls restaurant and it was lovely, even the vegetarian wife was happy. we would like to stress that although we were disappointed by the all inclusive aspect we do not in anyway blame the staff, they seemed to do the best with what they had available to them, but as a hotel i think they need to review some aspects then they will wonderful. \n",

(one of the slight errors was that we were handed a wrong to remote, but we didn't wanted to watch any so no big deal) we never took a bath in it again. i had a very unpleasant encounter with the waiter as i wanted to pour some coffee from the machine at 10.05 am when breakfast time was over he disconnected the power cord from the machine even though i came to the machine before him. very rude! what gave me an even more unpleasant surprise was the dinner: it wasn't a buffet! the dinner food portions were modest at best, i often stayed hungry afterwards, and the choice of food was bellow average. couple of times we were served tiny stakes (with a lot of spare fat) with some veggies but that was it. so all in all, the food is average at best. in the end, even though i had all these issues i managed to go around them in my head and enjoyed this gorgeous island for the ith time. as i was happy i was leaving the hotel it's safe to say that i won't be coming back to it ever again, even if i was offered free stay. the island is amazing, but look for accommodation elsewhere, i can't recommend golden sands at all: it's a 2 star hotel wrapped in a 3 star look. \n",
