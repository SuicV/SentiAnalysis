    "la méthode utilisé pour la classification a été proposé dans une blog [lien de blog](https://medium.com/@pmin91/aspect-based-opinion-mining-nlp-with-python-a53eb4752800) intitulé \"Aspect-Based Opinion Mining (NLP with Python)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "La méthode se base sur un lexique d'opinion proposé par Hu et Liu [lien vers le lexicon](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html#lexicon), pour déterminer la polarité d'un mot. Le lexique contient 6'800  mots divisés en mots positifs et négatifs.\n",

    "Cette méthode parcourt tous les tokens (mots, ponctuation, numéros, ...) dans la phrase traitée. Si le mot traité est dans le lexicon, on obtient sa polarité à partir de la liste (pos ou neg) où il appartient. Ensuite on utilise la technique [Dependency Parsing](https://realpython.com/natural-language-processing-spacy-python/#dependency-parsing-using-spacy) [(explication profond)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/14.pdf), pour récupérer la dépendance grammaticale entre le token traité (sentiment) et les autres token dans la phrase, afin d'extraire l'aspect dont le sentiment est lié.\n",

    "- Parcourir tous les tokens dans la phrase traitée;\n",
    "- Si le token est dans le corpus des mots de sentiments:\n",
    "- Vérifier si le mot positif affecte un score de 1, si non affecter un score de -1.\n",
    "    - Si le token s’agit d’un adverb comme ‘highly’ or ‘pretty” on l’ignore\n",
    "    - Si le mot s’agit d’un adjectif on extrait le mot dont il est lié comme un aspect, également on vérifie si l'adjectif lié à une négation et a un mot d'intensité pour augmenter l’intensité de sentiment. exemple :"

      " ======================\n",
      "reviews 1507 : My wife and I were booked into a superior room at this hotel for 5 nights as part of a 3 week tour of Argentina. We chose this hotel based upon the reference to spectacular views and the facilities such as restaurant and swimming pool and ease of location to brioche town.. The room was clean and the view was indeed great looking out over the lake. The hotel restaurant only provided a buffet meal in the evenings and having experienced eating there at breakfast ( which was like a site canteen with closely packed tables and no table cloths) we decided not to avail ourselves of this amenity Also there is no bar in which to relax after those long days of sightseeing. The access road comprises a steep dirt track which is unsuitable for walking on except in walking boots.

      "reviews 1767 : itayed Jan 3 to Jan 9,2015. The information sheet provided at the villa states there is a ceiling fan in the living room which does not exist so I sent an email regarding this and never got a reply so I asked at reception about this and if we could get a floor fan and her reply was she didn't think so. The main area is like a sauna so you need to turn up the air-conditioning in the bedrooms and leave the doors opened to cool off the living area, If there is a breeze you can open the back door and the doors leading to the deck to cool off the area and then use bug spray as you will undoubtedly have mosquitos etc coming in. so when they renovated they should have put in ceiling fans since the wiring would have already been installed, this would help circulate the air and minimize the cost of air-conditioning. The shower looks nice but not functional, there was no shelf to put your shampoo, soap Also the floor in the shower is smooth and slippery when wet so you need to careful when getting out. Also if you use face cloths, they don't have any at the villa although at their hotel property they are provided. In the second bathroom there was a bath towel with a large yellow stain and some dark yellow gel like matter on the towel which was discovered after using the bath towel, Their laundry needs to be improved as i wondered at times if the towels were thrown in the dryer without being washed and put back in the rooms, I was disappointed with this property. Service throughout cacao is lacking. Our experience with theft occurred at Daaibooi Beach in it. The 3 thugs were pretending to tend to their tire and broke into our van when we left for the beach. We left the beach and found the car parked at a local store not far from this beach. but I know that was a lie . There is a house behind the store which is where they probably were hiding or living . I took several pictures of the vehicle including the licence plate which I shared with the local police when we filed a police report. \n",

      "reviews 1788 : I thought I would give you a few helpful nuggets of info that you won't find on the silly site! so I kind of know what to expect on a camping break. The silly ones were true to form on this- ask them anything more challenging than the opening times for the shop and they looked at you with ill disguised panic as if you had asked them to do Calculus. All we wanted to do was to get in the mobile home, unpack and go for a quick snooze. In our experience,if you arrive before the official entry time, and I've always found it to be two rather than four am as it is on hippocampus, you can generally at least drop off your luggage at the caravan and quite often it's already been cleaned and you can get in. We were told to go for a swim instead. Eventually, we got into our accomodation and it was very much as expected. The third bedroom is very small, and I was glad that we had only brought two of our kids. The silly courier was very keen to point out to us that the evening entertainment on La siren across the road was \"THe Lion King\" and advised us to hurry up and get a seat as it would get very busy. I had chosen hippocampus as you can use all the facilities on La siren as well and I thought it looked a bit quieter, being a much smaller site. We realised this at around ten am when The Lion King really got going. You may be interested to know that \"wim a way\"is the same in French as English. I just wanted to go to sleep.... Throughout the week we were\" treated\" to disco,bongo drumming and a memorable version of Chicago. and it was as loud as if we were sitting right beside the stage. The only shop is across the road at siren, and be warned, its a very busy road, and hard to cross with a pile of shopping and several small children I would have thought. There is a wee bar on hippocampus with it's own entertainment but it was only open some of the nights we were there, inexplicably . No info from silly couriers on that!! angeles sur mer is a pretty village, and our teens liked the busy atmosphere, shops and restaurants. but they aren't particularly cheap. There is a lovely market in the village, and we also took a train to Perpignan- they run regularly from the station at angeles village(get off at the square and it's well signpost). So is aquaman,the nearby waterpark There is a trains which you can take from the roundabout at losers, to get you there. Again, not a cheap day out! Take your own picnic, unusually there is no restriction on taking food in to the park ,and it's very expensive to eat there . Bear in mind the waterslides are not supervised. All in all, we had a nice time- the area itself was lovely, and the father was perfect- there is a nice breeze for most of the time. On the website it says\" some noise may be heard from La siren\" but that is a gross misrepresentation. The main emphasis from the couriers is obviously on the evening entertainment rather than remembering to change your gas cylinder, and i think silly need to adress that. Maybe our camping days are at an end and we might go for a week in a nice hotel in the Italian Lakes. \n",

Everywhere else in the hotel you will have to pay, unfortunately all the fizzy drinks taste disgusting it's a shame as you can buy coke from the bar, but it's all at an extra cost!

In the span of 5 minutes, 2 servers and a manager told us we would have to move, as that section was closed until lunch. We got death stares from the restaurant manager but sill waited it out. They said we could order off the menu but most just did the buffet with the 2 meal plans; overpriced for continental or ridiculously overpriced for hot items such as eggs. I and my friend decided to skip breakfast and our wives again ate cold bagels from the vending machines in the lobby. Finally, one of the things that appealed to us was the fact that the hotel was connected to the town water park and the guest could use that pool. We were confused and did not want to pay extra to swim in the “hotel pool”. The door inside the hotel was convenient but once we used it, we were stopped by someone wanting us to pay to enter, even to look around. We could not get in without buying a wrist bracelet RFID tag that activated the turnstile. ( It would have been less confusing of the front desk just told us to use the voucher.) We started to look around and after finding our way through the maze of changing rooms to the main pool we got about 5 feet in before being stopped by another pool employee, who was incidentally wearing the same sandals I was. That was it! Passing several adorable small bakeries, breakfast places, and even a Starbucks as we drove through the city. Stay downtown. \n",

We were offered a change of room at midnight, but the thought of spending the next 2 hours moving rooms at midnight did not seem very attractive! Instead we were told by a manager, who seemed to have no training in customer relations, that it was our fault.

We headed back to the jetty, where and a member of staff appeared to have been sent to ensure we did so without any fuss, and presumably without stealing anything on our way out. Whilst we understand that the resort quite possibly couldn't accommodate guests simply dropping in unannounced, perhaps not even for a drinks at the bar, we do not accept the discourteous way in which we were dealt with by the manager. In his haste to ensure we left the premises, this man lost the resort a potentially very large booking, having offended us and our friends who now live on the island. \n",

Our neighbors had their luggage savagely slashed by a knife and we had all of our cash stolen during dinner. \"The only way on and off the island was by the resorts boat.\" As it turned there was a lot to worry about. We filed a complaint with the Bahamian police to no avail. We were literally run off the resort that morning and told to hurry and catch the boat to the plane.

Simply put, timo is great if you love the social atmosphere of a B&B and go on vacations as a way to meet lots of new people (we don't). We were very disappointed and felt that their website was totally misleading. But what about the rest of the guests?? This might be nice if you aren't on your honeymoon. I'm sure my parents, for example, would love it. But we didn't -- we just wanted to be by ourselves and it was impossible. You could ask to be seated away from the big table, but that involved arranging it in advance and it was really obvious that you had chosen to completely separate yourselves from The Group. C'mon. Of course, you can also carry your food to your room by yourself, but try trudging down a beach carrying a heavy tray laden with food while trying not to get eaten alive by mosquitoes. After 3 nights straight of small talk with people we'll never see again, we decided to suck it up and carry the food ourselves. Not joining us tonight, huh??\" It was like being back at camp! The owners claim that dinner time is their favorite time at timo, yet they were absent for most of our stay and never joined the group for dinner. Not once did anyone ask us how we were enjoying our stay. They also made no attempt to learn our names, which you'd expect when you own a resort that only services 20 people at a time. I really respect what they've done. The solar panels and the construction of the bungalows are very impressive. Plus, a week without the internet or to is a good thing. If you wanted ANYTHING - water, clean towels, food, drinks - you had to walk up to the main house and ask for it. It was really annoying. Their brochure claims to be honeymooners paradise, boasting that guests never have to leave their bungalow if they don't want to. This is only true if you never want to eat. Too bad! I don't mean to sound anti-social but it got old quickly. It began to take on the feel of a corporate retreat. We really missed this. The bungalows are screened-in and are private until you walk right up the steps -- then you can see straight in. Since the resort only has 10 bungalows, how difficult is it to keep track of where the guests are so that housekeeping can do their job without disturbing anyone?! For example, if you see Bungalow   eating their breakfast, THAT'S the time to go clean their room. It happened almost every day, so much so that I never felt truly \"alone\" in our bungalow. I kept waiting for the inevitable interruption, and when it would happen we wouldn't get an apology. I guess we should've felt bad for inconveniencing her?! This is prime mosquito season and it was unbearable!!! If you go at another time, him sure it's beautiful. It wasn't ALL bad, though: the guides are great and the snorkelling is outstanding. The water is gorgeous and the absence of loud motorized jet-skis was nice. Because the place is so close to its original state (as opposed to a resort that's cut everything down and paved over it) you could see crabs all over the place – it was really cool. The food was also outstanding, and the drinks were really good and not expensive at all. timo, we concluded, could be PERFECT if you went with friends and wanted to meet other people. \n",

      "reviews 1955 : I do, however believe really strongly in the power of Trip Advisor so I decided I had an obligation to post my experience so that others can make an informed decision. The second day there I was in the main lodge going through drummers to get to a different destination. The plan was to make this as eco-friendly as possible and I think they've achieved that, but I think there are downsides to this plan if you are planning to go to a caribbean destination for total relaxation and to be maybe pampered a bit at the same time (and isn't that why most of us go?) Even with the highest concentrate of Deet, the combinations of no-seems, mosquitos and horseflies are brutal. Their website is great and somehow 99% of the reviews make this sound like the most amazing place in the caribbean. It was interesting that at dinner virtually everyone I spoke to all found the resort on the internet and were impressed by the reviews. I have now made the conclusion that if you want the kind of trip we do (great food, a liitle to do but not much, a great beach, good snorkeling, good amenities and a little pampering, like maybe one or two massages), you need to budget easily $700 per night. I will say the kitchen does a decent job here. The little bungalows offer total privacy, but are very rustic with basically a bedroom in the middle of a four-sided densely screened porch surround. We literally had to hang a washcloth on them because that's the only way you could get enough grip to turn the water on. The composting toilet wasn't a big deal, but made us feel more like we were boating. I understand you could make arrangements early in the day to have separate seating, but the place is small enough, that would have appeared very awkward to the other guests. I want to have choices on vacation and not be forced to have duck when that's what they're serving that night. The beach is not at all impressive as this resort is on an inlet, not the coast of the ocean. The bugs are abominable and my wife particularly was bitten at least 75 times in a day with pretty sizable welts. Given the actual physical bug-bite issues my wife was trying to endure, I thought this was a poor gesture and there has been no follow up from the owners (who were on a different island when we had to make all the arrangements to leave) since.

Due to the fact that there are two banquet rooms for weddings, and there are several weddings each weekend, the people who say at the hotel are drunk, loud, and you can forget about getting any sleep during your stay. During our stay, a wedding party walked through the lobby at noon drinking beer from a cooler, then was so drunk that between midnight and 3 AM they were yelling, fighting, and drinking in the hallway, and were smoking weed in their rooms. When I told the manager, she stated that they knew of the issue but \"couldn't worry about it since they have to keep an eye on the entire property\". Oh, and you can forget about going to the hotel bar on a weekend night. Everyone waits half an hour to get a drink, and after ensuring before the visit that they would have a specific liquor to celebrate my brother's wedding, they did not have the liquor at the bar. Another frustration in regards to this hotel is that the room cleaners don't even come by to clean the rooms until you ask them to do so, and then do a poor job. I had to use a hand towel to dry myself. I have never had such poor customer service in my life. When I saw the charge on my bill, I wanted an explanation. She stopped talking to me when I was very upset about the charge on my room, just because I was mad about the damage charge. I asked for a manager to discuss the damage charge, but there was no manager on duty to deal with customer concerns at am on a Sunday, which is ridiculous. No one has time to play phone-tag, which is exactly what I ended up doing. I finally got the manager on the line, even though she did not call me after 24 hours had passed, and she pretended that she was interested in my concerns. After stating that the damage charge was valid, but admitting that they handled it wrong (but wouldn't discount it even though she admitted that she was wrong), she then half-listened to my concerns about the visit. She did not care about any of the hotel quality or customer service problems that I encountered, and finally stated that the damage charge would stand and she was sorry that I had a poor visit. I had never had a hotel not care about satisfying the customer and this just proves how poor of quality this hotel has. Do yourself a favor and stay at a different hotel, because if anything goes wrong during your stay, or they want to charge you for \"damage\" to your room to fill their pockets, they will do so without even caring or telling you. \n",

I would have at least liked to have decent cutlery and some variety. Upon hearing this, I thought it worth its while to let me office travel desk know. The next room was pleasant but again, I was provided no assistance even for shifting the room! I do not expect this from a Marriott. Anyway.. the same scenario repeated upon check out. Other guests at the hotel kindly offered help, but not a single staff! I realised after check out that I have left something behind in the hotel. They asked me to call back when the house keeping staff is available. Because I was informed that nothing was found in either of the rooms I stayed in! Then began the nightmare with the charges. Wow!

We got to our room, unpacked for the weekend and unmade our bed only to find the sheets very dirty with hairs all over them. How would you like to unmake your hotel bed and find hair all over the sheets? We called the front desk and she offered us to change rooms instead of offering to bring us new sheets or to have the sheets changed. She moved us to the handicap room and we are not handicapped and this room was not a normal room and did not seem as comfortable. However, it did not seem as comfortable as the other room and wasn't a regular hotel room like we had reserved. We called the front desk to complain about the dirty glasses and no bath soap and she said we could change rooms again. We still has the key to our old room so we went back to the old room and got some soap and had to go to a local gas station to get some bottled water since the glasses were dirty and there was no bottled water at the hotel. When I travel I get dehydrated and it is important to drink water, and with no bottled water and dirty drinking glasses it was more difficult to drink water. The people at the front desk didn't seem too apologetic about the dirty sheets or no soap or drinking water. Anytime I ever check into a Residence Inn there is always bottled water for purchase up at the front and they usually give me a free bottle of water upon check in since we are very frequent Residence Inn customers.

It was busy, and this front desk guy heard the busy tone and said \"they're not answering\" and took the phone from me! .... I called front desk around 9 am and the same front desk guy answered. His reply was plain and simple \"No! 12 am is check out time!\" I took a shower and checked out at 11 am!!!! I went to the front desk counter, (he was the one there), and I said I was checking out. I gave my card, he swiped it, gave my card back, and that was that. He just said \"yes!\" No have a good flight, or have a good rest of your day, that you would expect from a \"four star hotel\" that they claim they are! I am disgraced by the misconduct and rudeness of our front desk clerk and it made me uncomfortable around him and the hotel.

I am glad to say that Slimane was most helpful and took us to a little restaurant where we could get a meal - excellent - 100 dirhams each for three courses. As stated we had to be off early so went to bed -- my single bed had no quilt in the cover and simply had a folded blanket over the black (ugg) synthetic sheets (which felt like sleeping in a skirt lining!).

I took them over to the main building, once again interrupting the card playing duo. She then accompanied me back to the cabins and offered two pillows from an adjacent room. Then we looked closer - filthy, stained, smelly carpet that you wouldn't wish to set a naked foot on; tiny, dirty bathroom with a mouldy shower, a grubby wash basin and plumbing which seemed to leak from the wall. I pulled back the bedspread with some trepidation, despite the fact that the staff member assured me that the bed linen was changed on a regular basis (once a year perhaps??). To be fair it did appear clean but the grubby cups and the fur scaled jug sitting on a sticky bench suggested that cleaning wasn't a priority of the management. Everything but everything smacked of a total lack of concern, care or good housekeeping practice. and the general air of dilapidation was astounding. After booking in we scurried back to the no star Ben Mor Lodge where we packed the car, returned the key (yes, they were still playing cards) advised them of our departure and were told that they weren't surprised we were leaving. I have no idea what the meals might have been like (some reviewers have praised them) because the idea of sitting at the grubby tartan stools or at the dirty, sticky tables really had as much appeal as the tiny cabin room we vacated. I've formed the impression that the owners wouldn't have learned much from any other establishment they might have stayed in or, indeed the reviews on this site either as they haven't commented on the many unfavourable reviews. \n",

      "reviews 2618 : So Disappointing... Seeing all these great reviews, I have to wonder if my partner and I stayed at a different Inn, as my experience was VASTLY different. It was our first time in wine country so we were both excited, and the night at the Inn had been gifted to us by his parents. Pros: -The area itself is beautiful. Jordan is a sleepy little town that is very quiet and it's simply gorgeous. Especially at this time of year. Inn was dead quiet, which my partner and I both very much appreciated. The lobby was beautiful and modern. -The room was spacious and felt very grand. The ceilings were so high! -HUGE Loved that. -Our room fee included a free wine tasting at Cave Spring Cellars, across the street. Staff were VERY friendly and welcoming and we really enjoyed the wine! -The rooms still use real keys which we both thought was very cool. -I also love that the hotel still has a lot of character. It's very charming. We booked in late July and it took 6 weeks, a Facebook message, two emails, a voicemail, and three phone calls to get my email confirmation. The person I finally got in touch with on the phone was apologetic -For some reason unbeknownst to me, we were put in a room with two queen beds. so I found it disappointing that we weren't given a King bed (especially given the room rates), or at least a room meant for a couple. -The room itself is in dire need of an update. It still had a ad player on it! We had to move a side table out of the way to access an outlet for our phones. Not only were several pieces chipped/scratched, but nothing seemed to go together. All 3 of them were completely different and did not match. -Small details were just overlooked. There were stains on the carpet and scuffs on the walls. It was just sitting on top of the ledge from which the closet bar was hanging. There was a strange painting right across from our door, the colour on the bathroom walls is the same colour found on our basement walls in 1985, and the shower is essentially a hole in the wall. The shower curtain had also come off at least 3 of the hooks. None of these things are a deal-breaker, necessarily, but it all made the room look unkempt and not cared for. -The air conditioner--it had an awful, mildew smell coming out of it when it was turned on. Not pleasant. mini fridge in the room. The room only comes with a wine fridge, and considering all the wonderful food and cheese available nearby, my partner and I were very surprised when we heard there was no real fridge in the room. -Breakfast. I was prepared to rate this hotel higher but after our breakfast meal I was just put off. It was included, which we both appreciated, and served across the street from am-am. All the staff we encountered were very warm and friendly. The croissants and biscuits were absolutely heavenly. I could have filled up on those alone! We also were allowed juice, coffee, tea, and a hot item from the menu. The hot items included: -Eggs Benedict or Eggs Florentine, with Hollandaise sauce -Two eggs, any style, with bacon or sausage -Steel cut oats with garnish I ADORE eggs Benedict When our hot meals arrived we were both very disappointed. That was simply a failed Hollandaise. I was so disappointed as Eggs Benedict is probably my favourite breakfast item and I rarely get to have it. The one positive thing I can say is that the eggs were poached perfectly. Just 5 small home fries on my plate and they were SO salty I found them difficult to eat. It had a very strange texture and flavour. We also received fruit cups with our meal which was welcomed by both of us, until my partner discovered some mold growing on a blackberry in his cup. On top of that, the butter on our table was rock hard and had clearly just been taken out of the fridge, so putting it on toast was impossible. These are the types of issues I would expect to encounter at a $120/night chain hotel, but at an independently run, $250+/night Inn, I simply expected more and both of us left disappointed. \n",

How can a business hotel with a club floor lounge not function 7 days a week? Each day it was a game of what will not be replaced today - the tiny soap bar? fresh towels? bed linens? Management, simply shrugged off my comment. Hotel has an excellent laundry and dry cleaning service. The Breakfast buffet is a wild west affair with families on holiday I presume jostling one another grabbing food items and of course yelling at one another or maybe just conversing as loud as possible.

Having said that, since taxis are dead cheap in Hangzhou, there's no reason to stay so close to the lake. The check-in process was easy. The elevators in this 6-floor hotel are SO 1980's!!! The room itself is SUPER basic. The bathroom was tiny, and I mean TINY (something like ex.5 meters) with no shower. Since we were on the executive floor, we did get L'occitane bathroom amenities, but the bathroom itself was truly poor. The beds were ok - soft in a nice way (which was a nice change to most of China's HARD beds). We heard constant steps, chairs and tables moving, which eventually stopped around 11PM. Needless to say, we were all alone in there. The food was really really REALLY bad. Luckily, we have an advantageous card, that entitles us to a 50% discount on food. The next morning, we had a buffet breakfast, which was truly unimaginative and not that tasty. Naturally, we reported this to the duty manager, who promised this would be fixed by tomorrow. Needless to say - this did not happen. Westlake itself was very nice - we took a long walk in the afternoon and enjoyed it a lot (40 degrees + 85% humidity - ouch!). :) What a joke! We sat in the lounge and had a coffee and cake (which cost more than the dinner - go feature...). In the evening, we had a buffet dinner, which was the worst buffet dinner we had in China. The hilarious part was, that during our trip, we only stayed in actor hotels (softens and pullman) and somehow, this turned out to be the most expensive hotel (135$ per night for 2 people) and the worst hotel, at the same time. I can understand that this hotel is mainly targeted for Chinese tourists, who can be traded into believing this is how luxury looks like.

For the prices we were paying, we could have just as easily stayed at the Hyatt, which from what we hear is fantastic all around. The site that we booked through mistakenly booked us into a 2 twin bed room instead of a single king size. After discussing our options with her and getting nowhere, we asked to see the manager - it turned out that the manager had been standing at the reception area that entire time and despite our obvious distress, didn't even bother coming to see what the problem was until she was specifically requested. She also said there were rooms available - cost aside, why wouldn't the hotel automatically upgrade us without the hassle and cost? Instead of offering this, she immediately told us there would be an additional charge, and then called the travel agency we booked through to validate that there was a mistake in the booking. Once we got to the rooms, it was another disappointment. We booked a deluxe suite and were upgraded to god knows what, because the room we were given was dingy and completely outdated. The to was about 5 years old and dirty, like something you would see in a budget hotel, and to top it off, the sound tracking was off for all the channels so there was a 5 second delay from when someone on the television would say something to when you would actually hear it. The bathroom was also a bit of a disappointment - a shower stall that leaked on the floor, a bathtub with no shower curtain, a hair dryer that looked like it was from the is and blew out hot air that smelled like burning hair. The final complaint we had was with the lobby cafe - advertised as a magnificent lobby cafe with huge windows that look out onto the lake is a ridiculous lie, the cafe is just as dirty and dingy as the rest of the damn hotel.

      "reviews 2772 : We were looking for a nice weekend getaway outside of Shanghai and we wanted to spend some money on a nice hotel. so I can say that I am familiar with the value at this price level. This hotel was a huge disappointment. They said they were out of king bed rooms and therefore if we wanted one we would have to pay extra. We finally got them to upgrade us to \"luxury\" room after some arguing. In my opinion, if the hotel has room, why not upgrade your customer if you promised them something that is no longer available - The rooms are very outdated for a soften. This was not 5 star quality. but you must pay to use them--pay for the sauna!! The windows in the really gross lobby overlook the street and you cannot see the West Lake at all. We tried to get a taxi to take us to a nearby town (Moganshan) and the concierge, who could barely speak English, told me it would take 2 hours and 500rmb. I was so frustrated that the hotel couldn't figure out how to help us and instead they relied on the information from a \"taxi\" they called. These might not seem like major things but when you are paying these prices, there are clearly hotels that \"get it\" and are willing to give you the service you are paying for and deserve. P.S. I am writing this right now in my room at the soften because I am so upset with this experience. \n",

My husband & I were travelling with our 2 teenage daughters & I booked directly with soften for 2 rooms on the Club floor. We requested rooms with a nice view and the hotel emailed me back to say this wasn't a problem & they had allocated us rooms with a nice city view. What we ended up with were 2 cave like rooms with views of an apartment building you could just about reach out & touch. The rooms at this soften are nicely appointed with all the soften touches but very small. We also had a computer with internet connection in each room which was very handy. We were too tired to complain so decided to stay put. The club lounge was lovely with a view of the lake. The happy hour with yummy eats was very welcome and they even served a small tray of mixed deserts for my daughters which was a nice touch. The breakfast the next morning was also nice. The days we were in Hangzhou were unseasonably hot & very, very humid. The hotel said this was not a problem and said they would organise everything for rob 400. What we ended up with was a guide ( who was useless at explaining any history or anything of intrest) who walked us to the tourist boat rides & we only got to visit 2 places on the lake ( we had to buy his & our boat tickets & entry fees). After a couple of hours of this we called a halt ( our guide had hinted about lunch & I think he was hoping we would take him out somewhere nice!!!) On arrival back he followed us to the lifts & we had to give him a tip of rob100 to get rid of him.

      "reviews 2842 : We returned from Golden Sands on and May 2016, to say we were disappointed is an understatement. so expects to struggle, but usually I have no problems I will eat pretty much anything The drinks - we aren't big drinkers but the lager was nice, but the soft drinks were the cheapest of the cheap and then I can only assume water was added, again we had to purchase drinks to drink in the hotel. AREA - VERY, VERY Quiet, only a couple of shops and restaurants, which suited us fine as we are happy to simply go for walks trying to see wildlife, but if you like shopping etc be prepared to travel. so no major issues with these (struggled with putting toilet tissue in the bin mind). The biggest issue to us (I don't blame the hotel for this) is that the area is filthy, rubbish everywhere, beaches, roads, all bins over flowing, it's not nice and I would have expected such a beautiful country to take care of the basics a bit more! I would have happily given some money towards looking after the poor things as I think they bring something to the area but neutering and feeding really needs to be looked into. (Yes there are some) As soon as a dirty cup or plate was put down it was cleared away so no issues at all with the cleanliness. The views were stupendous and we could never get enough of either looking at the mountains or the sea, we had a side room so had a wonderful view of both. The local shops and restaurants were great, we visited Seagulls restaurant and it was lovely, even the vegetarian wife was happy. We would like to stress that although we were disappointed by the all inclusive aspect we do not in anyway blame the staff, they seemed to do the best with what they had available to them, but as a hotel I think they need to review some aspects then they will wonderful. \n",

      "reviews 2853 : It took around 45 minutes to get from the airport to the hotel, so it's not that long of a trip. From there onward was a mediocre experience at best. First impressions were great, the exterior looks nice, and so does the lobby. Bar in front of the hotel is great, nice variety of drinks, music was great and the mood was nice as well. There are hammocks hanging between the palm trees and the mood is great in the evening, it was great to chill out, swinging in the hammock, drinking a cocktail and enjoying the stars. The beach is very close by, just a minute long walk, but go left until you get to a cafe on the right (it was called al i think) as the beach in front of the hotel looks deserted. ----Now the bad stuff: Location even though nice is very small and to get anywhere on the island you HAVE to rent a car or a bike, not a scooter. Well the nearest more populated area is 15km away, while the keryaa city is around 30 at least, so i don't suggest that you drive for 30km on a scooter: it will take too long, it will be painful, and it will be dangerous as local drivers are not paying a lot of attention to what's happening on the road. For teens wanting to party still they drop: horrible location. The elevator in the hotel is padded with some sort of carpet completely and smells of dust very bad, feels like you're lying on a dirty carpet and all i wanted was to run out of it immediately. All rooms and balconies were dusty, and cleaning staff wasn't wiping any furniture or the floor. Tiling on the balcony was damaged in every room we've been, and sadly we've been to several as we were moved after 7 days to a different room because they needed our room for someone else as it was a 3 bed room. The room we were moved in was horrible. Their excuse was: Oh sorry, we missed that, thanks for telling us, we'll fix it immediately. Apparently it's leaking for some time as the area around the bottle has changed color from the rusty water (pic included). They also acted surprised when i told them about it. Finally i demanded to pick my own room and at least they made no fuss about it. Not cool as i had to sleep without taking showers, covered in salt. The handle falls off and i ended up having to open the tank and pull the mechanism myself after every visit to the toilet. (one of the slight errors was that we were handed a wrong to remote, but we didn't wanted to watch any so no big deal) We never took a bath in it again. I had a very unpleasant encounter with the waiter as i wanted to pour some coffee from the machine at 10.05 am when breakfast time was over he disconnected the power cord from the machine even though i came to the machine before him. VERY RUDE! What gave me an even more unpleasant surprise was the dinner: IT WASN'T A BUFFET! The dinner food portions were modest at best, i often stayed hungry afterwards, and the choice of food was bellow average. Couple of times we were served tiny stakes (with a lot of spare fat) with some veggies but that was it. So all in all, the food is average at best. In the end, even though i had all these issues i managed to go around them in my head and enjoyed this gorgeous island for the ith time. As i was happy i was leaving the hotel it's safe to say that i won't be coming back to it ever again, even if i was offered free stay. The island is amazing, but look for accommodation elsewhere, i can't recommend Golden Sands at all: it's a 2 star hotel wrapped in a 3 star look. \n",

A free basic buffet comes with your stay that has all the staple complementary foods. I understand he was a trainee On the other hand, I did have one exceptional staff member help me with facilitating a room change while the others left me in a very awkward and unsafe room. I sent email to the hotel commenting on her excellent customer service along with all the horrible things that happened. The sound insulation is very poor and you'll hear everyone from the parking lot. Wasn't until I talked to three staff members that I was able to move and that was because it was not only so noisy That's when I knew there was no way I was going to be staying in a shady room where they had to use a curtain to to hide the unfinished cement wall that it was hiding. But I was told that I shouldn't have been in that room because it was \"non operational\". Then WHY was I even given this room? Staff rudely called me at 9:10pm asking me to leave saying I shouldn't have been assigned that room. but nobody did. Well, I would still like to remind the hotel that I am a paying customer and that you CAN'T do that. Then, the to was flickering intermittently as if the room was possessed by a ghost or something, it was extremely bizarre. The saying is usually A for effort I will be following up with hotel management to investigate what happened in this situation. Contacted the University with an official complaint letter, and was told I would get a follow up by the end of the week. I'm escalating the claim higher but at this point, I see how poorly the public tax money from the people of Oregon are spent. A complete disappointment in all regards.
