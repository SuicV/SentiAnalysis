    "\n",
    "La méthode se base sur un lexique d'opinion proposé par Hu et Liu [lien vers le lexicon](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html#lexicon), pour déterminer la polarité d'un mot. Le lexique contient 6'800  mots divisés en mots positifs et négatifs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cette méthode parcourt tous les tokens (mots, ponctuation, numéros, ...) dans la phrase traitée. Si le mot traité est dans le lexicon, on obtient sa polarité à partir de la liste (pos ou neg) où il appartient. Ensuite on utilise la technique [Dependency Parsing](https://realpython.com/natural-language-processing-spacy-python/#dependency-parsing-using-spacy) [(explication profond)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/14.pdf), pour récupérer la dépendance grammaticale entre le token traité (sentiment) et les autres token dans la phrase, afin d'extraire l'aspect dont le sentiment est lié.\n",

    "#### Procédure de la méthode:\n",
    "- Parcourir tous les tokens dans la phrase traitée;\n",
    "- Si le token est dans le corpus des mots de sentiments:\n",
    "- Vérifier si le mot positif affecte un score de 1, si non affecter un score de -1.\n",
    "    - Si le token s’agit d’un adverb comme ‘highly’ or ‘pretty” on l’ignore\n",
    "    - Si le mot s’agit d’un adjectif on extrait le mot dont il est lié comme un aspect, également on vérifie si l'adjectif lié à une négation pour inverser la polarité de sentiment, et a un mot d'intensité pour augmenter l’intensité de sentiment. exemple :"
